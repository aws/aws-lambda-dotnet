# PowerShell script file to be executed as a AWS Lambda function.
#
# When executing in Lambda the following variables will be predefined.
#   $LambdaInput - A PSObject that contains the Lambda function input data.
#   $LambdaContext - An Amazon.Lambda.Core.ILambdaContext object that contains information about the currently running Lambda environment.
#
# The last item in the PowerShell pipeline will be returned as the result of the Lambda function.
#
# To include PowerShell modules with your Lambda function, like the AWSPowerShell.NetCore module, add a "#Requires" statement
# indicating the module and version.
#
# The following link contains documentation describing the structure of the S3 event object.
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/notification-content-structure.html
#
# This example demonstrates how to process an S3 Event that follows the process:
# S3 Event -> SNS Topic -> SQS Queue -> Lambda Function

#Requires -Modules @{ModuleName='AWSPowerShell.NetCore';ModuleVersion='3.3.485.0'}

# Uncomment to send the input event to CloudWatch Logs
#Write-Host (ConvertTo-Json -InputObject $LambdaInput -Compress -Depth 5)
