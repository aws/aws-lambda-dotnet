# ASP.NET Core Web API Serverless Application

This project shows how to run an ASP.NET Core Web API project as an AWS Lambda exposed through Amazon API Gateway. The NuGet package [Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer) contains a Lambda function that is used to translate requests from API Gateway into the ASP.NET Core framework and then the responses from ASP.NET Core back to API Gateway.


### Project Files ###

* serverless.template - an AWS CloudFormation Serverless Application Model template file for declaring your Serverless functions and other AWS resources
* aws-lambda-tools-defaults.json - default argument settings for use with Visual Studio and command line deployment tools for AWS
* LambdaEntryPoint.fs - type that derives from **Amazon.Lambda.AspNetCoreServer.APIGatewayProxyFunction**. The code in this file bootstraps the ASP.NET Core hosting framework. The Lambda function is defined in the base class.
* LocalEntryPoint.fs - for local development this contains the executable Main function which bootstraps the ASP.NET Core hosting framework with Kestrel, as for typical ASP.NET Core applications.
* Startup.fs - usual ASP.NET Core Startup type used to configure the services ASP.NET Core will use.
* web.config - used for local development.
* Controllers\ValuesController.fs - example Web API controller

You may also have a test project depending on the options selected.


## Here are some steps to follow from Visual Studio:

To deploy your Serverless application, right click the project in Solution Explorer and select *Publish to AWS Lambda*.

To view your deployed application open the Stack View window by double-clicking the stack name shown beneath the AWS CloudFormation node in the AWS Explorer tree. The Stack View also displays the root URL to your published application.

## Here are some steps to follow to get started from the command line:

Once you have edited your template and code you can deploy your application using the [Amazon.Lambda.Tools Global Tool](https://github.com/aws/aws-extensions-for-dotnet-cli#aws-lambda-amazonlambdatools) from the command line.

Install Amazon.Lambda.Tools Global Tools if not already installed.
```
    dotnet tool install -g Amazon.Lambda.Tools
```

If already installed check if new version is available.
```
    dotnet tool update -g Amazon.Lambda.Tools
```

Execute unit tests
```
    cd "BlueprintBaseName.1/test/BlueprintBaseName.1.Tests"
    dotnet test
```

Deploy application
```
    cd "BlueprintBaseName.1/src/BlueprintBaseName.1"
    dotnet lambda deploy-serverless
```
